description: Project motivation for T3 Chat Keyboard Extension (from README)
---

### Motivation

Enhance keyboard accessibility and introduce a lightweight, VS Code–inspired command palette for T3 Chat — an AI chat that lets you make requests to providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. This enables fast, keyboard-first navigation and command-driven actions.

### Scope

- Runs only on T3 Chat
- Built with TypeScript and Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- See more in [README.md](mdc:README.md)

### Core Ideas

- Keyboard-first navigation on T3 Chat
- Simple command palette concept so you can write commands to trigger actions

### Current Behaviors

- When the T3 Chat search input is focused, pressing Arrow Down moves focus to the first menu item
- Pressing Command+Shift+K inserts a `>` into the active input to begin a command
